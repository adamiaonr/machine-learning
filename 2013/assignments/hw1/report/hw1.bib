abstract = {There have been several recent proposals for content-oriented network architectures whose underlying mechanisms are surprisingly similar in spirit, but which differ in many details. In this paper we step back from the mechanistic details and focus only on the area where the these approaches have a fundamental difference: naming. In particular, some designs adopt a hierarchical, human-readable names, whereas others use self-certifying names. When discussing a network architecture, three of the most important requirements are security, scalability, and flexibility. In this paper we examine the two different naming approaches in terms of these three basic goals.},

@article{Perino2011,
abstract = {Content-Centric Networking (CCN) is a novel networking paradigm centered around content distribution rather than host-to-host connectivity. This change from host-centric to content-centric has several attractive advantages, such as network load reduction, low dissemination latency, and energy efficiency. However, it is unclear whether today's technology is ready for the CCN (r)evolution. The major contribution of this paper is a systematic evaluation of the suitability of existing software and hardware components in today's routers for the support of CCN. Our main conclusion is that a CCN deployment is feasible at a Content Distribution Network (CDN) and ISP scale, whereas today's technology is not yet ready to support an Internet scale deployment.},

@article{Stoica2002,
abstract = {Attempts to generalize the Internet's point-to-point communication abstraction to provide services like multicast, anycast, and mobility have faced challenging technical problems and deployment barriers. To ease the deployment of such services, this paper proposes an overlay-based Internet Indirection Infrastructure I3) that offers a rendezvous-based communication abstraction. Instead of explicitly sending a packet to a destination, each packet is associated with an identifier; this identifier is then used by the receiver to obtain delivery of the packet. This level of indirection decouples the act of sending from the act of receiving, and allows I3 to efficiently support a wide variety of fundamental communication services. To demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, we have designed and built a prototype based on the Chord lookup protocol.},

Management costs require a technically skilled human intellect, amounting to a substantial part of total cost of ownership. Self-management is positioned as a key capacity towards a scalable future Internet architecture. Herein we present key technological enablers for self-manageable future Internet systems, namely monitoring, decision-making and machine learning. We survey the state-of-the-art in network management aspects of these thematic areas and present a use case where their synergetic capacities render solutions to a known transport problem in wireless settings. Finally, we conclude the paper with a discussion of important issues for these technological enablers in the context of future Internet.},

In the field of data conversion, standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implements the usual quantized Shannon representation - the signal is uniformly sampled at or above the Nyquist rate. This article surveys the theory of compressive sampling, also known as compressed sensing or CS, a novel sensing/sampling paradigm that goes against the common wisdom in data acquisition. CS theory asserts that one can recover certain signals and images from far fewer samples or measurements than traditional methods use.},

abstract = {The dynamic classification and identification of network applications responsible for network traffic flows offers substantial benefits to a number of key areas in IP network engineering, management and surveillance. Currently such classifications rely on selected packet header fields (e.g. port numbers) or application layer protocol decoding. These methods have a number of shortfalls e.g. many applications can use unpredictable port numbers and protocol decoding requires a high amount of computing resources or is simply infeasible in case protocols are unknown or encrypted. We propose a novel method for traffic classification and application identification using an unsupervised machine learning technique. Flows are automatically classified based on statistical flow characteristics. We evaluate the efficiency of our approach using data from several traffic traces collected at different locations of the Internet. We use feature selection to find an optimal feature set and determine the influence of different features},

abstract = {The research community has begun looking for IP traffic classification techniques that do not rely on `well known TCP or UDP port numbers, or interpreting the contents of packet payloads. New work is emerging on the use of statistical traffic characteristics to assist in the identification and classification process. This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to IP traffic classification - an inter-disciplinary blend of IP networking and data mining techniques. We provide context and motivation for the application of ML techniques to IP traffic classification, and review 18 significant works that cover the dominant period from 2004 to early 2007. These works are categorized and reviewed according to their choice of ML strategies and primary contributions to the literature. We also discuss a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based traffic classifiers in operational IP networks, and qualitatively critique the extent to which the reviewed works meet these requirements. Open issues and challenges in the field are also discussed.},

@article{Donoho2006,
abstract = {Suppose x is an unknown vector in Ropfm (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure n general linear functionals of x and then reconstruct. If x is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements n can be dramatically smaller than the size m. Thus, certain natural classes of images with m pixels need only n=O(m1/4log5/2(m)) nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual m pixel samples. More specifically, suppose x has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)-so the coefficients belong to an lscrp ball for 0<ples1. The N most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with lscr2 error O(N1/2-1p/). It is possible to design n=O(Nlog(m)) nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the N most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those N important coefficients is extracted from the n measurements by solving a linear program-Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of "random" linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of n-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand n-widths of lscrp balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case 0<ples1, and give a criterion identifying near- optimal subspaces for Gel'fand n-widths. We show that "most" subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces},

@article{Popa2010,
abstract = {Over the past decade a variety of network architectures have been proposed to address IPs limitations in terms of flexi- ble forwarding, security, and data distribution. Meanwhile, fueled by the explosive growth of video traffic and HTTP in- frastructure (e.g.,CDNs, web caches),HTTP has became the de-facto protocol for deploying new services and applica- tions. Given these developments, we argue that these archi- tectures should be evaluated not only with respect to IP, but also with respect to HTTP, and that HTTP could be a fertile ground (more so than IP) for deploying the newly proposed functionalities. In this paper, we take a step in this direction, and find that HTTP already provides many of the desired properties for new Internet architectures. HTTP is a content centric protocol, provides middlebox support in the form of reverse and forward proxies, and leveragesDNS to decouple names from addresses. We then investigate HTTPs limita- tions, and propose an extension, called S-GET that provides support for low-latency applications, such as VoIP and chat.},

The eCAALYX Home Gateway relies in the use of open standardized protocols, as well as a modular architecture in order to create an unifying layer between sensors from several manufacturers and different caretaker entities. The performance analysis of our Home Gateway implementation indicates that such a system can run reliably on currently available off-the-shelf equipment, suggesting the practicability of a real-world deployment.},

Using new approaches to routing named content, derived heavily from IP, we can simultaneously achieve scalability, security and performance. We implemented our architecture's basic features and demonstrate resilience and performance with secure file downloads and VoIP calls.},

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are spearheading the efforts taken to build and deploy systems aiming to accomplish the ultimate objectives of the Internet of Things. Due to the sensors WSNs nodes are provided with, and to their ubiquity and pervasive capabilities, these networks become extremely suitable for many applications that so-called conventional cabled or wireless networks are unable to handle. One of these still underdeveloped applications is monitoring physical parameters on a person. This is an especially interesting application regarding their age or activity, for any detected hazardous parameter can be notified not only to the monitored person as a warning, but also to any third party that may be helpful under critical circumstances, such as relatives or healthcare centers. We propose a system built to monitor a sportsman/woman during a workout session or performing a sport-related indoor activity. Sensors have been deployed by means of several nodes acting as the nodes of a WSN, along with a semantic middleware development used for hardware complexity abstraction purposes. The data extracted from the environment, combined with the information obtained from the user, will compose the basis of the services that can be obtained.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous in-network caching is one of the key aspects of information-centric networking (ICN) which has recently received widespread research interest. In one of the key relevant proposals known as Networking Named Content (NNC), the premise is that leveraging in-network caching to store content in every node it traverses along the delivery path can enhance content delivery. We question such indiscriminate universal caching strategy and investigate whether caching less can actually achieve more. Specifically, we investigate if caching only in a subset of node(s) along the content delivery path can achieve better performance in terms of cache and server hit rates. In this paper, we first study the behavior of NNCs ubiquitous caching and observe that even na\"{\i}ve random caching at one intermediate node within the delivery path can achieve similar and, under certain conditions, even better caching gain. We propose a centrality-based caching algorithm by exploiting the concept of (ego network) betweenness centrality to improve the caching gain and eliminate the uncertainty in the performance of the simplistic random caching strategy. Our results suggest that our solution can consistently achieve better gain across both synthetic and real network topologies that have different structural properties.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel architecture for meeting Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of real-time traffic across consumer broadband links. In our approach the responsibility of QoS signalling is moved away from the application to the network. Network servers automatically identify traffic that might benefit from QoS and then trigger the provisioning of QoS by signalling network elements such as access routers. This approach removes the need for the application to signal to the network its explicit QoS requirements, making applications easier to develop and more portable. It also enables QoS provision for legacy applications for which there is limited opportunity to include explicit end-host signalling protocols. The paper develops the architecture required to realize the approach and discusses the underlying techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper we focus on the issue of transferring diverse kinds of information through information-centric networks (ICNs). We argue that the one request per packet mode of operation suggested in the early development of ICN applications is not a good fit for some types of traffic, such as media streams and real-time notifications. To efficiently deliver all kinds of information, we argue that an ICN should not only identify information by its name, it should also be aware of the nature of its traffic. We classify information traffic types based on two characteristics: a) reliable vs. unreliable transfer and b) real-time vs. on-demand delivery. The combination of these two characteristics leads to three broad categories: a) channels, b) on-demand documents and c) real-time documents. To handle all traffic types, we propose two extensions to the CCN architecture: Persistent Interests and Reliable Notifications. We describe how these additions, together with a careful selection of information names, can efficiently support these three categories of information traffic types. \&copy; 2011 ACM.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are networks of distributed autonomous devices that can sense or monitor physical or environmental conditions cooperatively. WSNs face many challenges, mainly caused by communication failures, storage and computational constraints and limited power supply. Paradigms of computational intelligence (CI) have been successfully used in recent years to address various challenges such as data aggregation and fusion, energy aware routing, task scheduling, security, optimal deployment and localization. CI provides adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. CI brings about flexibility, autonomous behavior, and robustness against topology changes, communication failures and scenario changes. However, WSN developers are usually not or not completely aware of the potential CI algorithms offer. On the other side, CI researchers are not familiar with all real problems and subtle requirements of WSNs. This mismatch makes collaboration and development difficult. This paper intends to close this gap and foster collaboration by offering a detailed introduction to WSNs and their properties. An extensive survey of CI applications to various problems in WSNs from various research areas and publication venues is presented in the paper. Besides, a discussion on advantages and disadvantages of CI algorithms over traditional WSN solutions is offered. In addition, a general evaluation of CI algorithms is presented, which will serve as a guide for using CI algorithms for WSNs.},

abstract = {Energy efficient system design is becoming increasingly important with the proliferation of portable, battery-operated appliances such as laptops, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and cellular phones. Numerous dedicated hardware approaches for energy mini- mization have been proposed while software energy efficiency has been relatively unex- plored. Since it is the software that drives the hardware, decisions taken during software design can have a significant impact on system energy consumption. This thesis explores avenues for improving system energy efficiency from application level to the operating system level. The embedded operating system can have a significant impact on system energy by performing dynamic power management both in the active and passive states of the device. Software controlled active power management techniques using dynamic volt- age and frequency scaling have been explored. Efficient workload prediction strategies have been developed that enable just-in-time computation. An algorithm for efficient real- time operating system task scheduling has also been developed that minimizes energy consumption. Portable systems spend a lot of time in sleep mode. Idle power management strategies have been developed that consider the effect of leakage and duty-cycle on sys- tem lifetime. A hierarchical shutdown approach for systems characterized multiple sleep states has been proposed. Although the proposed techniques are quite general, their appli- cability and utility have been demonstrated using the MIT $\mu$AMPS wireless sensor node an example system wherever possible. To quantify software energy consumption, an esti- mation framework has been developed based on experiments on the StrongARM and Hitachi processors. The software energy profiling tool is available on-line. Finally, in energy constrained systems, we would like to have the ability to trade-off quality of ser- vice for extended battery life. A scalable approach to application development has been demonstrated that allows energy quality trade-offs.},
